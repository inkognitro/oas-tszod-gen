# oas-to-code
A code generator to convert [OpenApiV3](https://swagger.io/specification/) specifications into endpoint caller functions for [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev).

## Why should I use `oas-to-code`?
- to use your [OAS3](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification as a single-source-of-truth for your endpoint definitions
- to have the possibility for an automatic compatibility check of your api endpoints with your TS frontends
- to write less code that could lie, leading to fewer bugs and improved customer satisfaction

## Why yet another library for this task?
Before you consider using this library, I suggest having a look at [Zodios](https://www.zodios.org/)
and [openapi-zod-client](https://github.com/astahmer/openapi-zod-client) first.

I coded my own solution because I wanted to
- have separated functions and type definitions for each API endpoint in a single file located in a folder of its context
- be able to easily test these endpoint caller functions with exchangeable `RequestHandler` implementations
- have automatically generated [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas for any endpoint request data that can be used for form validations

## Semantic versioning
**Worried about different code generation outputs after updating this library?**

As long as the API contract on the backend side was not violated through breaking changes,
you don't have to worry about breaking changes in generated code output after migrating to the next **minor** version.


## Usage of the generator
The following script can be used in the development process of your application.
This will generate several files and folders depending on your OAS3 specification.

```typescript
import { generateOas3ToTs } from 'oas-to-code';
const myOas3Specification = require('./path/to/my/oas3Specification.json');

generateOas3ToTs({
  getSpecification: () => {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      resolve(myOas3Specification);
    });
  },
  outputFolderPath: './my-output-folder',
  predefinedFolderOutputPaths: [
    ['core'], // puts variables and type definitions in the `./core` folder for generated outputs which have an `OutputPath` starting with ['core']
    ['util', 'foo'], // puts variables and type definitions in the `./util/foo` folder for generated outputs which have an `OutputPath` starting with ['util', 'foo']
  ],
  logger: {
    log: (content) => {
      console.log(content);
    },
  },
  shouldGenerateWithZod: true, // In case of `false`, only TypeScript output is generated without Zod schemas
});
```

### What is an OutputPath?
Variables, functions and type definitions which are generated by this generator come in form of an `output`.
A `output` is an object which has a `path` property in it. This property is of type `OutputPath` (= `string[]`).
The first few entries of the `OutputPath` array do represent the filepath in which the variables and type definitions are going to be put in.
The remaining entries of this array are used for the type or the variable name.

Let's consider some example endpoints which might be defined in your OAS3 specification under the `paths` variable:

1. The outputs for the endpoint with the operationId `auth.authenticate` will be put into `./auth/authenticate.ts`
2. The outputs for the endpoint with the operationId `userManagement.getUsers` will be put into `./user-management/getUsers.ts`
3. The outputs for the endpoint with the operationId `userManagement.admin.getUsers` will be put into `./user-management/admin/getUsers.ts`

## Usage of generated code
Following example demonstrates:
1. How to "onion"-bootstrap different implementations of the `RequestHandler` interface
2. How to trigger a request from an example endpoint which has the operationId `auth.authenticate` in the OAS3 specification

 ```typescript
import {
  AxiosRequestHandler,
  AxiosRequestHandlerExecuteConfig,
} from './axiosRequestHandler';
import {
  AuthRequestHandler,
  AuthRequestHandlerExecuteConfig,
  HttpBearerAuthenticationProvider,
} from './authRequestHandler';
import {authenticate} from './my-output-folder/auth';

declare global {
  interface RequestExecutionConfig
    extends AxiosRequestHandlerExecuteConfig,
      AuthRequestHandlerExecuteConfig {}
}

const exampleAuthenticationProvider: HttpBearerAuthenticationProvider = {
  type: 'httpBearer',
  findToken: () => {
    return 'my-access-token';
  },
  securitySchemeName: 'example', // OAS3 security name
};

const requestHandler = new AuthRequestHandler(
  [exampleAuthenticationProvider],
  new AxiosRequestHandler({baseURL: 'https://my-api.com'})
);

const optionalConfig: RequestExecutionConfig = {
  onUploadProgress: progress => console.log('uploadProgress', progress),
};

const requestResult = await authenticate(
  requestHandler,
  {usernameOrEmail: 'inkognitro', password: '12345678'},
  optionalConfig
);

console.log(requestResult);
```

At the time of writing this, it exists the `ScopedRequestHandler` as the only additional `RequestHandler` implementation.
With this one you can make sure its methods `cancelRequestById` and `cancelAllRequests`, only cancel the requests
which originally have been triggered via its `execute` method.

This might for example come into play when you want to provide a custom React hook
`useRequestHandler` which provides a `RequestHandler` for components.
When a component gets unmounted, you will be able to only cancel running requests which
originally were triggered from inside exactly that component.
The `cancelAllRequests` method then can be called from a `useEffect`'s cleanup function
inside your `useRequestHandler` hook.
