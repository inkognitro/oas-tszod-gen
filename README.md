# oas-to-code
A tool to convert [OpenApiV3](https://swagger.io/specification/) specifications into callable endpoint functions for [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev).

## Why should I use `oas-to-code`?
- to use your [OAS3](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification as a single-source-of-truth for your endpoint definitions
- to have the possibility for an automatic compatibility check of your api endpoints with your TS frontends
- to write less code that could lie, leading to fewer bugs and improved customer satisfaction

## Why did you write yet another library for this task?
Before you consider using this library, I suggest having a look at [Zodios](https://www.zodios.org/)
and [openapi-zod-client](https://github.com/astahmer/openapi-zod-client) first.

I coded my own solution because I wanted to
- have fine-grained and separated functions and type definitions for each API endpoint
- be able to easily test these endpoint caller functions with exchangeable `RequestHandler` implementations
- have automatically generated [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas for any endpoint request data, which can be used for form validations

## Semantic versioning
**Worried about different code generation outputs after updating this library?**

As long as the API contract on the backend side was not violated through breaking changes,
you don't have to worry about breaking changes in generated code output after migrating to the next **minor** version.


## Usage
The following script can be used in the development process of your application.
This will generate several files and folders depending on your OAS3 specification.

```typescript
import { generateOas3ToTs } from 'oas-to-code';
const myOas3Specification = require('./path/to/my/oas3Specification.json');

generateOas3ToTs({
  getSpecification: () => {
    return new Promise<object>(resolve => {
      resolve(myOas3Specification);
    });
  },
  outputFolderPath: './my-output-folder',
  predefinedFolderOutputPaths: [
    ['core'], // puts generated variables and type definitions in the `./core` folder for generated outputs which have an `OutputPath` starting with ['core']
    ['util', 'foo'], // puts generated variables and type definitions in the `./util/foo` folder for generated outputs which have an `OutputPath` starting with ['util', 'foo']
  ],
  logger: {
    log: (content) => {
      console.log(content);
    },
  },
  shouldGenerateWithZod: true, // In case of `false`, only TypeScript output is generated without Zod schemas
});
```

### What is an OutputPath?
Every variable or type which is generated by this generator comes in form of an `output`.
A `output` is an object which has a `path` property in it. This property is of type `OutputPath` (= `string[]`).
The first few entries of the `OutputPath` array do represent the filepath in which the variables and type definitions are going to be put in.
The remaining entries of this array are used for the type or the variable name.

Let's consider some example endpoints which might be defined in your OAS3 specification under the `paths` variable:

1. The variables and type definitions for the endpoint which has `auth.authenticate` as a value in the `operationId` property will be generated to the `./auth/authenticate.ts` file.
2. The variables and type definitions for the endpoint which has `userManagement.getUsers` as a value in the `operationId` property will be generated to the `./user-management/getUsers.ts` file.
3. The variables and type definitions for the endpoint which has `userManagement.admin.getUsers` as a value in the `operationId` property will be generated to the `./user-management/admin/getUsers.ts` file.
